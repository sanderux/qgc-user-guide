# QGroundControl Quick Start

Getting _QGroundControl_ up and running is quick and easy:

1. [Download and install](../getting_started/download_and_install.md) the application.
2. Start _QGroundControl_. 
3. Attach your vehicle to the ground  device via USB, through a telemetry radio, or over WiFi. _QGroundControl_ should detect your vehicle and connect to it automatically.

That's it! If the vehicle is ready to fly,  _QGroundControl_ should display [Fly View](../FlyView/FlyView.md) as shown below \(otherwise it will open [Setup View](../SetupView/SetupView.md)\).

A good way to become familiar with _QGroundControl_ is to start experimenting:

* Use the [toolbar](../toolbar/toolbar.md) to switch between the main views:
  * [Settings](../SettingsView/SettingsView.md): Configure the _QGroundControl_ application.
  * [Setup](../SetupView/SetupView.md): Configure and tune your vehicle.
  * [Plan](../PlanView/PlanView.md): Create autonomous missions.
  * [Fly](../FlyView/FlyView.md): Monitor you vehicle\(s\) while flying, including streaming video.
* Click the _Status icons_ on the toolbar to find out the status of the connected vehicle. 

While the UI is fairly intuitive, this documentation can also be referenced to find out more.
